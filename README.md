# Polynomial-Regression-for-Salary-Data
In this scenario, I have used polynomial regression to predict the appropriate salary for a Human Resource company that seeks to determine the salary for a new job position based on available data. With access to a salary dataset containing information for the top 10 positions and their corresponding levels, the company aims to make an informed decision for a new position falling between levels 7 and 8. Utilizing polynomial regression, we can model the relationship between position levels and salaries to predict the appropriate salary for the new position within the specified range.
